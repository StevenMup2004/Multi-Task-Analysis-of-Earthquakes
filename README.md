## Project Overview

This project presents a multi-task data science analysis of earthquake data.  
The goal is to explore seismic characteristics and build predictive models for different earthquake-related tasks, including both regression and classification problems.

The project follows a standard data science workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to feature selection, modeling, and evaluation.
